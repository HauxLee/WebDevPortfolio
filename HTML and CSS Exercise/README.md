# HTML and CSS Exercise

Welcome to the HTML and CSS Exercise, a project designed to deepen my understanding and proficiency with HTML and CSS by imitating a given web page layout and functionality.

## Objectives

- **Familiarization with HTML and CSS:** Gain a solid grasp of HTML and CSS technologies through hands-on practice.
- **Web Page Imitation Skills:** Learn to accurately replicate a web page from an image, utilizing HTML and CSS without the aid of any design tools beyond a text editor.

## Project Description

This project involves the recreation of a web page based solely on provided screenshots and a video demonstration. The challenge is to replicate the page's design and functionality as closely as possible using only HTML and CSS.

### Key Points:

- **Direct Coding:** All elements of the page were hand-coded using a basic text editor, enhancing skills in writing and modifying HTML and CSS directly.
- **Resource Limitation:** The task was completed using four specific images (`image1.png`, `image2.png`, `image3.png`, and `flower.png`) without relying on any additional graphics.
- **Link Functionality:** The page features five active links ("Home", "Services", "About", "Gallery", and "Contact") that navigate to different sections of a secondary page (`page2.html`), showcasing the ability to create internal link navigation within a site.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the web page and defining its content.
- **CSS3:** For styling the web page, including layout, colors, and fonts.

This link directs to a live version of the project, allowing you to interact with the fully functional web page and its features.

## Testing

The web page was tested in Firefox, ensuring that it closely matches the provided screenshots when the browser window is resized to match the dimensions of the `image1.png`. This testing process was crucial for verifying the accuracy of the page's layout, font choices, color schemes, and text positioning.

## Submission Details

This project has been linked to the table of content on my GitHub Pages site and the source code is available for review. The submission includes two HTML files (`index.html` and `page2.html`) and one CSS file to demonstrate the structure and style of the project.
